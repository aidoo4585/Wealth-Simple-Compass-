About Wealthsimple
Wealthsimple is on a mission to help everyone achieve financial freedom by reimagining what it means to manage your money. Using smart technology, we take financial services that are often confusing, opaque, and expensive and make them transparent and low-cost for everyone. We're the largest fintech company in Canada, with over 3+ million users who trust us with more than $100 billion in assets. Our teams ship often and make an impact with groundbreaking ideas. We're looking for talented people who keep it simple and value collaboration and humility as we continue to create inclusive and high-performing teams where people can be inspired to do their best work.

What This Is
We're not hiring for a traditional role. We're building a small team of cross-functional builders to rethink how modern AI should change the way work actually gets done — not by layering AI onto old workflows, but by rebuilding business processes from scratch as AI-native systems.

This is not a resume-driven process. Instead of telling us what you've done, we're asking you to build something real.

If selected, you'll join Wealthsimple full-time to work alongside an experienced AI leader and domain experts to ship systems that operate in the real world — ones that handle real cognitive and operational responsibility, at scale.

What You'll Do
As an AI Builder, you'll own the full path from problem to shipped system to real-world adoption. That means:

Identifying business processes that evolved before modern AI existed and redesigning them from scratch as AI-native workflows

Prototyping quickly, testing assumptions, and iterating based on operational reality

Working across functions, including engineering, regulatory & compliance, and go-to-market — not specializing in just one

Collaborating with domain experts to pressure-test ideas before they go live

Making explicit decisions about where AI should take on responsibility — and where it shouldn't

This isn't a role where you execute someone else's roadmap. You bring the judgment.

Who This Is For
You might be early in your career. Or not. What matters to us is speed, judgment, and ownership. This is a technical role, but not a narrow one. It’s for builders who think in systems, move comfortably across disciplines, and know how to turn ambiguity into shipped work.

You see yourself as a mix of product thinker, engineer, operator, and strategist, not confined to a single function.

You're a strong fit if you:

Have looked at a legacy system and thought, "This wouldn't exist like this if it were built today"

Prototype quickly and operate end-to-end - from system design to real-world rollout.

Can coordinate complex, cross-functional work without losing momentum.

Have hands-on experience building with AI tools, models, or APIs

Care deeply about whether something would actually work in the real world — not just in a demo

Are energized by change and lean into new technology rather than waiting to be told to

You don't need a background in fintech. You don't need to know how Wealthsimple works internally. We're evaluating how you reason, what assumptions you make explicit, and how you design under real-world constraints.

How to Apply
Instead of a resume, we're asking you to build something.

Design and prototype an AI system that meaningfully expands what a human can do. This might mean:

Rebuilding a legacy workflow

Handling far more complexity or serving far more people

Making higher-quality decisions

Operating reliably in situations that were previously impractical

Your system must:

Clearly define the human's role

Take on real cognitive or operational responsibility

Explicitly name one critical decision that must remain human — and why

What to submit:

Demo video (2–3 minutes). Show the system actually working.

Short written explanation (max 500 words) covering: what the human can now do that they couldn't before; what AI is responsible for; where AI must stop; and what would break first at scale.

Your salary expectation and years of hands-on experience with AI tools or systems.

No decks. No resumes.
