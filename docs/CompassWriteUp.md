Wealthsimple Compass: Structural Clarity in Retail Trading

What the human can now do that they couldn't before:
Previously, retail investors were forced to navigate "The Interpretation Gap." A user sees a TSLA $250 Call at $7.50, but they don't instinctively "see" that the stock must rise 3.2% just to break even, or that their probability of 100% loss is high. Compass expands the human’s capability by giving them the "intuition of a floor trader." They can now move from "price-based" guessing to "reality-based" decision making, acknowledging structural risks (like Theta decay or cost-basis inflation) that were previously buried in technical charts.

What AI is responsible for:
The AI serves as a translation layer between the raw exchange data and the user's mental model. It is responsible for:

Scenario Synthesis: Calculating the "Break-Even Reality" and "Max Loss" in plain English.

Contextual Comparison: Contrasting a leveraged position (Options) against a delta-one position (Shares) to show the opportunity cost of risk.

Cognitive Guardrails: Generating the "Clarity Checkpoint"—a set of acknowledgments derived specifically from the trade's unique risk profile.

Where AI must stop:
The AI must never provide financial advice or "Buy/Sell" recommendations. It stops at explanation. It defines the "What" (the mechanics of the trade) but never the "Should" (the wisdom of the trade). The final decision to commit capital must remain human because only the user understands their non-quantifiable life context—their debts, their family goals, and their emotional capacity for loss.

What would break first at scale:
At scale, the primary "breaking point" is Contextual Hallucination. If the AI misinterprets a complex multi-leg strategy (like an Iron Condor) as a simple directional bet, it could provide a false sense of security. Ensuring 100% mathematical accuracy in the translation of "Greeks" into "English" across millions of permutations is the highest operational hurdle.
